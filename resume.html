            <ul class="list-indent">
                <li>Fluent Home is a Home Security and Automation company. I have worked for them in the capacity of Lead Technician since 2011 and have been doing similar work in the industry since 2006.</li>
                <li>After my first year in the industry (2007) I took on a management role where I recruited, trained, and managed my own team of techs. In addition to managing the team I also had to manage the team's inventory, ensuring they had the equipment necessary to do their jobs and enough additional equipment to keep up with usage. </li>
                <li>I played a pivotal role in training new technicians before they hit the field. Fluent, as well as the company I worked for prior, hired large amounts of techs for a summer sales/install program. Each year as we hired new teams of technicians I was part of the team that taught training classes for new hires as well as more advanced courses for returning technicians.</li>
                <li>In 2019 I took on the role of Corporate Trainer. In this role I trained new techs both in a classroom and in the field. While in this role I was also in charge of creating my own curriculum through the utilization of Google Classroom. I created many slideshows that detailed product demonstrations, customer interaction scenarios, and just general things to know before going out into the field. Through google forms I wrote my own exams and quizzes to ensure the technicians were able to hit the ground running.</li>
                <li>Over the years i have trained (and in some cases also hired) new technicians numbering well over a hundred</li>
