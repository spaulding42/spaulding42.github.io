            <p>Hi, so I'm guessing if you've made it the about me section that you're looking to gain a little insight about what my story is! I'll keep this breif and try to give relevant information</p>
            <p>I first started programming in highshool over 20 years ago. At the time I was only interested in game development and made a bunch of silly games just to challenge myself I made them using <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/visual-basic/" style="color:black;"> Visual Basic </a>  and some 3D games in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Game_Creators" style="color:black;">Dark Basic</a>. An unfortunate side effect of youth is that I wasn't very good about backing up my data and a few computers later I lost the games I programmed.</p>
            <p>I started attending College in 2003 to pursue a degree in Computer Science. Part way through my degree program I got a summer job installing home security systems and enjoyed it quite a lot a the time. I liked it enough that I made it a career for 17 years. This job required me to travel the country which i loved. It forced me out of my comfort zone by requiring me to build a rapport with my clients and my team.</p>
            <p>I rapidly moved up the ranks and established myself as the Go-to guy for any install that was complicated or requiring a delicate touch with a client. We mostly did same-day appointments and I would have to balance giving the client a great product and keeping the next client willing to let me still do the install same day. </p>
            <p>My "come to jesus" moment was when I realized I didn't want to be crawling through attics when I was 60! At that point I started thinking about what I wanted to do with the rest of my life and one thing stood out. It was the very thing that I would say in highschool when people would ask "what do you want to be when you grow up?". <span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: larger;">I want to be a computer programmer!</span> </p>
            <p>Like lifting weights then quitting for so long your muscles atrophy and you can't bring yourself to going back down to those lower weights. After 17 years my programming skills had atrophied and it was holding me back from pursuing my dream job. I knew that it was time to burst the bubble I had placed around myself and dive back into the trenches.</p>
            <p>I started researching coding bootcamps to see if I could get my learning jump started again. I found <a href="http://www.codingdojo.com" style="color: black;" target="_blank">Coding Dojo</a> and knew that it would be the catalyst that reignited my passion.</p>
            <p>Once in the bootcamp i started kicking myself for not doing it sooner! It was so nice to find a job where every day is like solving a new puzzle! I don't regret doing alarms because it taught me valuable skills like <span style="font-weight: bold;">troubleshooting, breaking a job down into manageable chunks, and the pride in delivering a quality product</span></p>
            <p>I learned the <span style="font-weight: bold;">AGILE</span> development method to make a seemingly impossible task be broken down into pieces that are no longer overwhelming. That and using a <a href="https://trello.com/guide/trello-101" style="color: black;">Trello board</a> to organize the tasks was one of the biggest take-aways from the bootcamp and has helped me to keep moving forward well after graduating.</p>
